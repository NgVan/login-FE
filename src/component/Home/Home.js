            <p>
                I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
                To take a stand, it's been a ride
                Everybody, I guess I had to
                Go to that place
                To get to this one
                Now some of you
                Might still be in that place
                If you're tryin' to get out
                Just follow me
                I'll get you there
                You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
                But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
                'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
                When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
                I don't give a damn what you think
                I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
                It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
                I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
                And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
                No if, ands or buts, don't try to askâ€¦
            </p>
